# Visualizing-the-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

# Overview/Introduction

The Nobel Prize is one of the most prestigious international awards, recognizing outstanding contributions in fields such as Chemistry, Literature, Physics, Medicine, Economics, and Peace. This project explores the history of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023 using data from the Nobel Prize API. The goal is to uncover trends and insights related to prize winners, including gender distribution, country of origin, and categories of awards.

# Objectives

1. Analyze the gender distribution of Nobel Prize winners over time.
2. Identify the countries with the most Nobel Prize winners.
3. Explore trends in prize categories and the rise of female laureates.
4. Highlight notable winners, including repeat winners and the first female laureate.

# Data Source

The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the nobel.csv file. It includes information on:
- Year: The year the prize was awarded.
- Category: The category of the prize (e.g., Chemistry, Literature, Physics).
- Laureate Information: Name, gender, birth country, and organization details.
- Prize Details: Motivation, prize share, and more.

# Tools Used

- Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Data Visualization: Seaborn for count plots and trend analysis.
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and transforming data for analysis.

# Insights

1. Gender Trends:
    - Male winners dominate the Nobel Prize, with only 65 female laureates as of 2023.
    - The Literature category has the highest proportion of female winners.
2. Geographical Trends:
    - The United States leads in the number of Nobel Prize winners, followed by European countries like the UK and Germany.
    - The 2000s saw the highest proportion of US-born winners.
3. Category Trends:
    - Physics and Chemistry have the most repeat winners.
    - Marie Curie is the only individual to win Nobel Prizes in two different categories (Physics and Chemistry).
4. Repeat Winners:
    - Organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross and individuals like Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger have won multiple times.

# Key Findings

1. Gender Distribution: The majority of Nobel Prize winners are male, with only a small percentage of winners being female.
2. Top Country: The United States of America has the highest number of Nobel Prize winners (291), followed by the United Kingdom (91) and Germany (67).
3. Decade with Most US Winners: The 2000s had the highest proportion of US-born winners.
4. Female Laureates: The Literature category has the highest proportion of female winners, with the 2020s being the decade with the most female laureates.
5. First Female Winner: Marie Curie was the first female Nobel Prize winner, awarded in Physics in 1903.
6. Repeat Winners: A few individuals and organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and Marie Curie, have won the Nobel Prize multiple times.

# Recommendations

1. Encourage Diversity: Efforts should be made to increase the representation of women and underrepresented countries in Nobel Prize nominations.
2. Further Research: Explore the reasons behind the dominance of certain countries and categories in Nobel Prize awards.
3. Public Awareness: Highlight the achievements of female laureates and repeat winners to inspire future generations.
